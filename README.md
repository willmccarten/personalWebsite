# Hello! Welcome to my website repo!

I made this website using the help of this great [tutorial](https://youtu.be/G-Cr00UYokU). 

This project was mainly to get exposed to **React**, **CSS**, and **HTML** in more depth. The best way I saw to do that is to learn by following along myself. In the end I also get a cool website that can act as a physical representation of what I have been learning. 

I also got exposure to **SwiperJS** and **EmailJS** which are both used in this project. 



Read below for the Creat React App information to get your own version of the site started.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
